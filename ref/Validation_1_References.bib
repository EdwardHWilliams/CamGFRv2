abstract = {Estimating glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is essential for clinical practice, research, and public health. Appropriate interpretation of estimated GFR (eGFR) requires understanding the principles of physiology, laboratory medicine, epidemiology, and biostatistics used in the development and validation of GFR estimating equations. Equations developed in diverse populations are less biased at higher GFRs than equations developed in chronic kidney disease (CKD) populations and are more appropriate for general use. Equations that include multiple endogenous filtration markers are more precise than equations including a single filtration marker. The CKD-EPI (CKD Epidemiology Collaboration) equations are the most accurate GFR estimating equations that have been evaluated in large diverse populations and are applicable for general clinical use. The 2009 CKD-EPI creatinine equation is more accurate in estimating GFR and prognosis than the 2006 MDRD (Modification of Diet in Renal Disease) Study equation and provides lower estimates of prevalence of decreased eGFR. It is useful as a "first test" for decreased eGFR and should replace the MDRD Study equation for routine reporting of serum creatinine-based eGFR by clinical laboratories. The 2012 CKD-EPI cystatin C equation is as accurate as the 2009 CKD-EPI creatinine equation in estimating GFR, does not require specification of race, and may be more accurate in patients with decreased muscle mass. The 2012 CKD-EPI creatinine-cystatin C equation is more accurate than the 2009 CKD-EPI creatinine and 2012 CKD-EPI cystatin C equations and is useful as a confirmatory test for decreased eGFR as determined by serum creatinine-based eGFR. Further improvement in GFR estimating equations will require development in more broadly representative populations, including diverse racial and ethnic groups, use of multiple filtration markers, and evaluation using statistical techniques to compare eGFR to "true GFR."},

abstract = {Abstract Background Carboplatin chemotherapy is used to treat Ovarian cancer (OC) in the adjuvant, neoadjuvant and palliative settings. Carboplatin is normally dosed by the Calvert formula: [GRF+25] x AUC, with a target AUC (area under the plasma concentration curve) of 5-6 mg/ml/min. GFR is precisely measured with radionuclide based ligands such as 51Cr-ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (51Cr-EDTA). GFR is often estimated using formulae incorporating serum creatinine, weight and age, with the Cockcroft–Gault (CG) or Wright (WR) formulae. It is unknown if these formulae sufficiently accurately doses carboplatin in OC patients. Method We retrospectively compared EDTA-based and estimated (CG and WR formulae) GFR and the resulting carboplatin doses, in women with stage 1c to IV OC treated with carboplatin AUC 6 at our centre between 2015 and 2016. All patients had concurrent 51Cr-EDTA GFR and serum creatinine measurement before starting carboplatin. Accuracy and bias of The WR and CG formulae were analysed using mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and mean percentage error (MPE). Results 92 patients were included in the study (median age= 69 years (r. 25 -89), median serum creatinine 63.5 umol/L (r. 38 – 168)). MPE was -37.3 and -26.0 and MAPE was 38.0 and 32.2 for the WR and CG formulae, respectively. There was discrepancy in dosing with the WR and CG formulae compared to measured GFR with at least 10{\%} in 77.1{\%} and 69.8{\%} of patients, respectively; a discrepancy of 50{\%} or more would have occurred in 10{\%} and 13{\%} of patients. Conclusion Neither the WR nor CG formulae precisely predict renal function in ovarian cancer patients. They often overestimate GFR which could lead to most patients receiving higher carboplatin doses. Our findings are relevant for clinical practice and for the design and interpretation of clinical trials, where the choice between EDTA or formulae-based calculations of carboplatin dose are often left to investigators' preference.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND The National Kidney Foundation has advocated the use of the abbreviated Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation to estimate glomerular filtration rate (GFR) from serum creatinine measurements in clinical laboratories. However, healthy persons were not included in the development of the MDRD equation. OBJECTIVES To assess the accuracy of the MDRD equation in patients with chronic kidney disease compared with healthy persons and to develop a new equation that uses both patients with chronic kidney disease and healthy persons. DESIGN Cross-sectional study. SETTING The Mayo Clinic, a tertiary-care medical center. PARTICIPANTS Consecutive patients (n = 320) who had an iothalamate clearance test specifically for chronic kidney disease evaluation and consecutive healthy persons (n = 580) who had an iothalamate clearance test specifically for kidney donor evaluation. MEASUREMENTS Serum creatinine levels, GFR, demographic characteristics, and clinical characteristics were abstracted from the medical record. RESULTS The MDRD equation underestimated GFR by 6.2{\%} in patients with chronic kidney disease and by 29{\%} in healthy persons. Re-estimated coefficients for serum creatinine and sex were similar to the original MDRD equation in the chronic kidney disease series but not in the healthy series. At the same serum creatinine level, age, and sex, GFR was on average 26{\%} higher in healthy persons than in patients with chronic kidney disease (P {\textless} 0.001). A quadratic GFR equation was developed to estimate logarithmic GFR from the following covariates: 1/SCr, 1/SCr2, age, and sex (where SCr = serum creatinine). LIMITATIONS The new equation was not developed in a general population sample. Elderly and African-American persons were underrepresented. CONCLUSION The MDRD equation systematically underestimates GFR in healthy persons. A new equation developed with patients who have chronic kidney disease and healthy persons may be a step toward accurately estimating GFR when the diagnosis of chronic kidney disease is unknown.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Seminoma stage I is the most frequent testis cancer and single-dose carboplatin (AUC7) is an effective and widely used adjuvant treatment. Underdosing of carboplatin by 10{\%} has been shown to almost double the rate of relapse and hence correct dosing based on accurate GFR measurement is crucial. The gold standard of GFR measurement with a radiolabelled isotope is expensive and not readily available. In many institutions, it is replaced by GFR estimation with the Cockcroft-Gault formula, which might lead to significant carboplatin underdosing and potentially inferior clinical outcome. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of all patients with stage I seminoma treated with adjuvant carboplatin between 1999 and 2012. All patients had serum creatinine measured and underwent GFR measurement with a radioisotope ((51)Cr EDTA or (99m)Tc DTPA), which was compared with seven standard GFR estimation formulae (Cockcroft-Gault, CKD-EPI, Jelliffe, Martin, Mayo, MDRD, Wright) and a flat dosing strategy. Bias, precision, rates of under- and overdosing of GFR estimates were compared with measured GFR. Bland-Altman plots were done. RESULTS: A total of 426 consecutive Caucasian male patients were included: median age 39 years (range 19-60 years), median measured GFR 118 ml/min (51-209), median administered carboplatin dose 1000 mg (532-1638). In comparison to isotopic GFR measurement, a relevant proportion of patients would have received {\textless}/= 90{\%} of carboplatin dose through the use of GFR estimation formulae: 4{\%} using Mayo, 9{\%} Martin, 18{\%} Cockcroft-Gault, 24{\%} Wright, 63{\%} Jelliffe, 49{\%} MDRD and 41{\%} using CKD-EPI. The flat dosing strategy, Wright and Cockcroft-Gault formulae, showed the smallest bias with mean percentage error of +1.9, +0.4 and +2.1, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Using Cockcroft-Gault or any other formula for GFR estimation leads to underdosing of adjuvant carboplatin in a relevant number of patients with Seminoma stage I and should not be regarded as standard of care},

abstract = {In order to determine the morphological and biological covariables which better predict the glomerular filtration rate in cancer patients, we performed the present study in a population of 123 patients (78 men, 45 women) with various tumor types; 55 of these patients had previously received cisplatin, and 12 had undergone unilateral nephrectomy. The 51Cr-EDTA plasma concentration versus time data of 80 patients were analysed according to a population pharmacokinetic approach by using the Nonlinear Mixed Effects Model (Nonmem) program. The best fit for 51Cr-EDTA clearance estimation was given by the following formula: [formula: see text] (with ABW for actual body weight in kg, age in years, sex = 0 if male and sex = 1 if female, and Scr for serum creatinine in mumol/l). Actual body weight was the most predictive morphologic parameter, and the adjustment was not improved by taking into account the ideal body weight. The GFR of patients previously treated with cisplatin was 18{\%} lower than that of untreated patients age for age. However, this covariable was not present in the final model because it was redundant with other covariables, likely Scr. The formula was then prospectively evaluated with the data of 43 other patients. The mean (+/- SD) ratio between GFR predicted according the Nonmem formula and the observed GFR was 0.95 +/- 0.23 which did not differ significantly from unity. Conversely, the mean ratio between creatinine clearance calculated according to the Cockcroft-Gault equation and the observed GFR (0.86 +/- 0.21) differed significantly from unity. This study shows that in cancer patients the formula to calculate GFR drawn from Nonmem analysis is more accurate than the Cockcroft-Gault equation. However, an accurate determination of GFR requires specific techniques as 51Cr-EDTA clearance investigation.},

abstract = {Purpose The glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is essential for carboplatin chemotherapy dosing; however, the best method to estimate GFR in patients with cancer is unknown. We identify the most accurate and least biased method. Methods We obtained data on age, sex, height, weight, serum creatinine concentrations, and results for GFR from chromium-51 (51Cr) EDTA excretion measurements (51Cr-EDTA GFR) from white patients ≥ 18 years of age with histologically confirmed cancer diagnoses at the Cambridge University Hospital NHS Trust, United Kingdom. We developed a new multivariable linear model for GFR using statistical regression analysis. 51Cr-EDTA GFR was compared with the estimated GFR (eGFR) from seven published models and our new model, using the statistics root-mean-squared-error (RMSE) and median residual and on an internal and external validation data set. We performed a comparison of carboplatin dosing accuracy on the basis of an absolute percentage error {\textgreater} 20{\%}. Results Between August 2006 and January 2013, data from 2,471 patients were obtained. The new model improved the eGFR accuracy (RMSE, 15.00 mL/min; 95{\%} CI, 14.12 to 16.00 mL/min) compared with all published models. Body surface area (BSA)-adjusted chronic kidney disease epidemiology (CKD-EPI) was the most accurate published model for eGFR (RMSE, 16.30 mL/min; 95{\%} CI, 15.34 to 17.38 mL/min) for the internal validation set. Importantly, the new model reduced the fraction of patients with a carboplatin dose absolute percentage error {\textgreater} 20{\%} to 14.17{\%} in contrast to 18.62{\%} for the BSA-adjusted CKD-EPI and 25.51{\%} for the Cockcroft-Gault formula. The results were externally validated. Conclusion In a large data set from patients with cancer, BSA-adjusted CKD-EPI is the most accurate published model to predict GFR. The new model improves this estimation and may present a new standard of care.},

The 4-variable equation from the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) Study has been reexpressed for use with a stan- dardized assay. Objective: To describe the performance of the revised 4-variable MDRD Study equation and compare it with the performance of the 6-variable MDRD Study and Cockcroft–Gault equations. Design: Comparison of estimated and measured GFR. Setting: 15 clinical centers participating in a randomized, controlled trial. Patients: 1628 patients with chronic kidney disease participating in the MDRD Study. Measurements: Serum creatinine levels were calibrated to an assay traceable to isotope-dilution mass spectrometry. Glomerular filtra- tion rate was measured as urinary clearance of 125I-iothalamate. Results: Mean measured GFR was 39.8 mL/min per 1.73 m2 (SD, 21.2). Accuracy and precision of the revised 4-variable equation were similar to those of the original 6-variable equation and better than in the Cockcroft–Gault equation, even when the latter was corrected for bias, with 90{\%}, 91{\%}, 60{\%}, and 83{\%} of estimates within 30{\%} of measured GFR, respectively. Differences between measured and estimated GFR were greater for all equations when the estimated GFR was 60 mL/min per 1.73 m2 or greater. Limitations: The MDRD Study included few patients with a GFR greater than 90 mL/min per 1.73 m2.Equationswerenotcom- pared in a separate study sample. Conclusions: The 4-variable MDRD Study equation provides rea- sonably accurate GFR estimates in patients with chronic kidney disease and a measured GFR of less than 90 mL/min per 1.73 m2. By using the reexpressed MDRD Study equation with the standard- ized serum creatinine assay, clinical laboratories can report more accurate GFR estimates.},

abstract = {The frequent need to obtain an estimate of renal function in cancer patients, not least for targeting carboplatin dose, has led to a number of approaches to estimate glomerular filtration rate (GFR). This study aimed to develop a simple and reliable method to estimate GFR using readily-available patient characteristics. Data from 62 patients with estimates of 51Cr-EDTA clearance were analysed to determine the most appropriate formula relating this method of measuring GFR to patient characteristics. The population pharmacokinetics of 51Cr-EDTA were analysed using NONMEM to evaluate the influence of each covariate. The formulae derived were then validated using a further 38 patients and compared with those obtained using existing formulae. 51Cr-EDTA clearance (GFR) was positively related to Dubois surface area, negatively related to age, and inversely related to serum creatinine (SCr). Females had lower 51Cr-EDTA clearance than males. The enzymatic method of SCr assay gave more reliable results than the Jaffe colorimetric method. A measure of creatine kinase significantly improved the estimation of GFR. The new formula produced estimates of GFR which were less biased (Mean Prediction Error = -3{\%}) and more precise (Mean Absolute Prediction Error = 12{\%}) than Cockcroft and Gault (-8{\%} and 16{\%}) or Jelliffe (-15{\%} and 19{\%}) estimates. The formulae developed here can be used to provide reliable estimates of GFR, particularly in regard to targeted dosing of carboplatin},
